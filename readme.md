This script reads the server log file for the Trackmania server hosting the
ManiaExchange Knockout Competition. The server runs a custom private dedicated
controller called "BOG".

The goal of this project is to scrape the logs and glean the history of all
KOs. If you found this codebase there is probably not much you could use this
script for unless you happen to have some KO BOG logs.
